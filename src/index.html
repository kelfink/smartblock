   <title>Example 1 --- Simple SmartBlock Demo</title>
</head>
<body>


This example shows a short demo.&nbsp;
The creature is larger (8 blocks), the genetic code is short, the lifespan is longer (150),
and the applet moves more quickly.  .&nbsp; 16 generatoins of 16 trials each will
be run.
<p>
<a href="smartblocks.jar"> the JAR </a>
<applet code='org.smartblocks.Ex2'
         archive='smartblocks.jar'
           width="600" height="400" align="TOP">
  <param name="blocksize" value="3">
  <param name="blocks" value="8">
  <param name="lifespan" value="150">
  <param name="dna_length" value="8">
  <param name="trials" value="16">
  <param name="generations" value="16">
  <param name="sleep" value="8">
</applet>


</p><p>
Look for the small wiggling creature in the left hand corner.

Press BEGIN to start the experiment.
The creature will begin moving according to an initial set of instructions.
After a period of time (determined by parameters passed to the applet) the creature will
be terminated, and a new trial will begin, with a slight mutation of the original.
</p><p>
32 such trials will be conducted, and of these, the best performer will be picked to
reproduce.  That new instruction set will be mutates 32 times, in 32 trials, 
and the procerss repeats.
