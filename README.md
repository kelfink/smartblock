# smartblock
A genetic algorithms experiment.  Connected blocks evolve to solve obstacle puzzles.

Dredged up from archive.org's depths, my CSU Chico Artificial Intelligence survey course project from <cough-cough> a while back. 
I originally wanted to mae this into a platform for building and solving arbitrary puzzles.  

The project was originally a Java applet.  That might change.
